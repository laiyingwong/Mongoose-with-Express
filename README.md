# Mongoose-with-Express

This project integrates **Mongoose** with **Express** to create a **Mongo** database and a simple **Express** web app. The app is built with **RESTful** routes and it implements **CRUD** functionality. Users can add new products, edit existing product information, and delete unwanted products from the database.

## ‚ú® What I Have Learned

**MongoDB** is a **NoSQL** database that's non-relational. To connect **MongoDB** with **JavaScript**, we use a library called **Mongoose**. **Mongoose** uses schemas (mappings of different collection keys from **Mongo** to different types in **JavaScript**) to model the data an application wishes to store and manipulate in **MongoDb**. This includes features such as type casting and validations.

With **Mongoose**, we would define a `Schema` object to preset the structure for documents (files/containers of individual items) in the collection (a group of documents). Then we need to create a `Model` object based off the schema to create instances and represent information in a **Mongo** database.
